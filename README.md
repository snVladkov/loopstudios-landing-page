## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- JavaScript

### Notes

Tailwind was a bit hard to learn in the beginning but once you get familiar with basics it get very comfortable to work with. I will be using it in future projects for sure. I also used this cool underline animation I found on [CSS-IRL](https://css-irl.info/animating-underlines/). You can check it out [here](https://css-irl.info/animating-underlines/).
